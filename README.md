# Task Management System Using C++

**Course:** ITE-001  
**Program:** BS in Computer Science  
**Institution:** Technological Institute of the Philippines  
**Year Level:** First Year
**Group Name:** @Mmarsharctechnologies

## Project Overview

This project is a **Task Management System** built using C++. It is designed to help users manage and track their tasks efficiently. Developed as part of the ITE-001 course, the system applies fundamental C++ programming concepts such as data structures, file handling, and user interaction.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple but effective tool for managing tasks, while showcasing the practical application of C++ for basic task management.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks:** Input task name, description, priority, and due date.
- **View Tasks:** List all tasks and sort them by priority or deadline.
- **Edit/Update Tasks:** Modify task details or mark them as completed.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Task data is saved to a file and loaded when the program is restarted.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TadashiJei/Task-Management-System.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Task-Management-System

3. **Compile the program: Use a C++ compiler such as g++ to compile the source code:**
   ```bash
   g++ task_management.cpp -o task_manager

4. **Run the program: After compiling, run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./task_manager

- ** Usage **
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a simple command-line menu. Hereâ€™s how you can use the system:

- ** Add a Task: Choose the option to add a new task and provide its title, description, deadline, and priority level.
- ** View Tasks: View all tasks in a list format. You can sort them by priority or deadline to manage them efficiently.
- ** Edit a Task: Select an existing task to update its details or mark it as completed.
- ** Delete a Task: Remove tasks from the system once completed or no longer needed.
- ** Persistent Storage: The system saves tasks to a file, so they are preserved between program sessions.
